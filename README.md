# Feedforward Neural Network Implementation

## Description

This repository presents an implementation of a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) developed as part of the IF3270 Machine Learning course requirements. The framework offers a flexible architecture that allows users to construct and train custom neural networks by specifying their own configuration of layers, activation functions, loss functions, and weight initialization techniques.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.

   ```bash
   https://github.com/RayhanFadhlan/FFNN.git
   cd FFNN
   ```

2. Setup python virtual environment and install dependencies.

   ```bash
   make
   ```
